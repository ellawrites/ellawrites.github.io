Ella M. Lee spent years in the tech industry before getting back to her story-crafting roots. In her spare time, she likes to travel, cook, drink tea and coffee, and spend some weekday mornings repeating moves, spins, and jumps over and over again for her figure skating coaches. She has a loving husband and two semi-loving cats who share her home near Boston, MA.
